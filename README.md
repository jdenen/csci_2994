# Agile Development and Testing
This is our repository for the Columbus State CSCI-2994 class.

## Outline
I'd like to use the project's README as a detailed class outline. As plans change and we adapt to student pace, we should adjust the outline here and reuse that information in later iterations.

### Week 1
Week 1 will be pretty lecture heavy. We want to do a quick Ruby overview and briefly introduce a lot of ideas.
- Agenda
- TDD Calculator

### Week 2
Week 2 should balance lecture and lab well. We'll be rehashing the Week 1's kata to introduce stories, scenarios, and Gherkin.
- Agenda
- Cucumber-ing the Calculator

### Extra Katas
We want to ensure that students are writing a lot of code. So we need a bank of katas for them to try.
- Convert to Roman Numeral
- Convert from Roman Numeral
- FizzBuzz
- Sentence reversal
- Non-natural sorting
