# Week 3

## Introduction to ATDD

### How do we test an app that we can't see?

-   **Conversation** on what it means to be test driven.
-   What tests go behind the acceptance criteria?
    -   How do we identify valid tests?

## Step by step guide to writing an acceptance test

-   Defining done (testing quadrant)
-   Deriving scenarios from stories with our definition
-   Add pending steps
-   Describe step defs in plain English
-   Identifying/gathering test data
-   Whiteboarding the UI
-   Implement expectation
-   Proving legitimate assertions with stubs
-   Implementing page classes and helper modules
-   **Communicate** UI expectations with developers
-   This is a scenario that fails for the right reasons!

## Introduce the Final Project

### Stories

	As an author
	I want to create a post
	So that I can share my knowledge with the world

	As a reader
	I want to read posts from my favorite blogger
	So that I can learn something

	As a reader
	I want to read an entire post
	So that I can get all the details

	As a reader
	I want to search for posts by title
	So that I can find specific information

	As an author
	I want to delete posts
	So that I can hide my stupidity

### Walk through the guide for one scenario

## Scrumming in our Final Project

### How do we organize our work in an agile team?

-   Agile is not a methodology
-   Scrum is an agile framework

### What is a backlog?

-   Work you haven't done yet
-   Prioritized
-   Broken into 3 categories (timeboxed to a sprint):
    -   todo
    -   wip
    -   done
-   Focus of the daily scrum

### What is a daily scrum?

-   Daily, project-focused organization
-   What is the plan for the day?
-   How does the plan get us closer to our sprint goals?

## Homework

-   Create a backlog for your remaining work
-   Convert stories to scenarios
-   Get to the point of stubbing assertions on those scenarios
